This mod improves the interactions with wolves by adding 3 different types of wolves.

This mod adds new wolves types to the game in order to make wolves more interesting. Wolves gain stats, 
are able to hold items, and will play with toys.

Wolf types will transform to other wolf types when the owner holds a food item while performing an action
such as killing a mob or breaking an ore block.

The fighter wolf is the strongest variant of all wolves and is able to level up the strength variable faster than 
other wolf types.

The fighter wolf will automatically attack all enemies when it is smart enough and will automatically attack creepers when it is strong enough.
