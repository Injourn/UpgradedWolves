This mod improves the interactions with wolves by adding 4 different types of wolves.

Currently the only implemented wolf is the fighter wolf.

In order to train wolves, you need to:
1. hold a food item that can be fed to a wolf
2. Perform the action related to the wolf type
(Killing a Monster, Mining an ore block, talking to a villager, Farming a plant item)
3. Feed the food item to a wolf.

Over time the wolves will have special abilities to improve specific tasks for wolves to perform.
